# Intelligent-Voice-Bot-for-Customer-Interaction
This project is a functional AI Voice Bot designed to handle customer queries and perform backend data retrieval. The bot listens to voice input, processes the intent using a Large Language Model (LLM), fetches dynamic user data (such as account balance), and responds via synthesized speech.
